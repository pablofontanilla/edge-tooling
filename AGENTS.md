## Repository Overview

Edge Tooling is a multi-tool deployment and development toolkit for OpenShift and edge computing environments. The repository provides automation for deploying OpenShift clusters in various configurations, managing cloud infrastructure, and setting up development workspaces.

## Tool Quick Reference

| Component | Path | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Two-Node Toolbox | `two-node-toolbox/` | OpenShift two-node cluster deployment (arbiter/fencing topologies) |
| EC2 Deploy | `ec2-deploy/` | Standalone EC2 instance setup for development |
| SNO Deploy | `sno-deploy/` | Single Node OpenShift with DU configuration |
| Payload Monitor | `payload-monitor/` | Nightly payload health monitoring for edge topologies (SNO/TNA/TNF) |
| openshift-tests (TNF) | `openshift-tests/` | Run `openshift-tests` suites (recovery, DualReplica, cert-rotation, e2e, upgrade) against TNF clusters with cluster-side log captures |
| CI Tooling | `ci-tooling/` | Sippy Component Readiness and related CI helper CLIs |
| LVM Operator Environment | `environments/lvm-operator/` | Development workspace template for LVMS |
| Plugin Marketplace | `plugins/` | Claude Code plugin marketplace for OpenShift/edge workflows |

**Use case routing:**

- Two-node HA cluster → Two-Node Toolbox
- EC2 dev host → EC2 Deploy (often used as hypervisor for Two-Node Toolbox)
- Single-node OpenShift → SNO Deploy
- LVM Operator development → LVM Operator Environment
- Monitor nightly payload health for edge topologies → Use Payload Monitor
- Run or debug `openshift-tests` recovery/e2e suites on a TNF cluster → openshift-tests (`openshift-tests/docs/USER-GUIDE.md`)
- Component Readiness snapshot (HA vs TNF/TNA/SNO) → CI Tooling (`ci-tooling/readiness-report`)
- Claude Code plugins for OpenShift/edge → Plugin Marketplace (`/plugin marketplace add openshift-eng/edge-tooling`)

For commands, flags, prerequisites, and workflows: read the component's README.md or Makefile.

## Contributing

PRs use the fork model: push to `fork` remote, open PR against `origin` (`openshift-eng/edge-tooling`).

Run `npx markdownlint-cli2 '**/*.md'` before committing to catch lint violations.
