# Edge Tooling

Automation, AI skills, and deployment tools for OpenShift edge engineering. This repo is the OpenShift Edge team's shared toolkit — it provides cluster deployment automation for edge topologies (two-node HA, SNO, LVM), CI and release workflow tooling, and a Claude Code plugin marketplace that gives engineers AI-assisted skills for day-to-day work.

## Which tool do I need?

| Use case | Component |
|----------|-----------|
| Two-node HA cluster (arbiter or fencing) | [two-node-toolbox/](two-node-toolbox/) |
| EC2 dev host or hypervisor | [ec2-deploy/](ec2-deploy/) |
| Single Node OpenShift with DU config | [sno-deploy/](sno-deploy/) |
| LVM Operator development workspace | [environments/lvm-operator/](environments/lvm-operator/) |
| Nightly payload health monitoring | [payload-monitor/](payload-monitor/) |
| Run `openshift-tests` suites against a TNF cluster with log captures | [openshift-tests/](openshift-tests/) |
| Component Readiness triage report (HA vs edge) | [ci-tooling/readiness-report/](ci-tooling/readiness-report/) |
| Multi-repo workspace management | [workspace plugin](plugins/workspace/) via the marketplace |
| Claude Code plugins for edge workflows | [plugins/](plugins/) via the marketplace |

## Getting started

### Local setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:openshift-eng/edge-tooling.git
cd edge-tooling
make setup-githooks
```

`make setup-githooks` installs a pre-commit hook that runs markdownlint on staged `.md` files.

Prerequisites: Node.js (for markdownlint), Python 3, Bash.

Each deployment tool has its own prerequisites — see the component README for what you need.

### Installing plugins

From within Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add openshift-eng/edge-tooling
```

Then enable whichever plugins you need. See the [plugin README](plugins/README.md) for details.
